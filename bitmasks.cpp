/*
Bitwise operations
  - AND: & 
    returns a 1 in each bit position where both operands have a 1

    - OR: |
    returns a value with a 1 in each bit position 
    where at least one of the operands has a 1

  - XOR: ^
    returns a value with a 1 in each bit position 
    where the corresponding bits of the operands are different
    (it's like asking are the bits different?)

  - NOT: ~
    inverts all bits of the operand
    (it's like asking what is the opposite?)
    When dealing with signed integers, NOT can lead to unexpected results
    due to the way negative numbers are represented in binary.

  - Left Shift: <<
    shifts all bits of the operand to the left by a specified number of positions
    (it's like multiplying by 2 for each shift)

  - Right Shift: >>
    shifts all bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions
    (it's like dividing by 2 for each shift)

All the bitwise operations are commutative, meaning that:
  - a & b == b & a
  - a | b == b | a
  - a ^ b == b ^ a
